# Operational Procedures: MTTD, MTTR, Escalation Policies, and KPIs

## **1. Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**

### **Definition:**
MTTD measures the average time it takes for the SOC to detect a security incident after it occurs.

### **Formula:**
```
MTTD = Total Detection Time for All Incidents / Total Number of Incidents
```

### **Best Practices to Reduce MTTD:**
- Implement **SIEM correlation rules** for faster anomaly detection.
- Utilize **Threat Intelligence Feeds** to proactively detect Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
- Automate **alert triage and prioritization** to avoid detection delays.
- Leverage **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)** to detect anomalies.
- Adopt **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques to map adversary behaviors.

### **SOC Benchmark:**
- **<30 minutes** for critical incidents.

## **2. Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**

### **Definition:**
MTTR measures the average time it takes to contain and remediate a security incident after detection.

### **Formula:**
```
MTTR = Total Response Time for All Incidents / Total Number of Incidents
```

### **Best Practices to Reduce MTTR:**
- Automate **incident containment** (e.g., isolate infected endpoints, disable compromised accounts).
- Establish **incident response playbooks** for common attack scenarios.
- Conduct **SOC drills and tabletop exercises** to optimize response strategies.
- Utilize **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** tools to speed up response.
- Follow **NIST 800-61** guidelines for structured incident response.

### **SOC Benchmark:**
- **<60 minutes** for critical incidents.

## **3. Escalation Policies**

### **Objective:**
Ensure that security incidents are escalated appropriately based on severity and impact.

### **Industry Best Practices (ISO/IEC 27035, NIST 800-61):**
- Define **incident severity levels** aligned with business impact analysis.
- Establish **clear communication channels** for escalation.
- Use **pre-approved incident handling procedures** for quick resolution.

### **Incident Severity Levels:**
| **Level** | **Description** | **Escalation Path** |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Low (L1)** | Minor security alerts requiring no immediate action | SOC Analyst → Log for Review |
| **Medium (L2)** | Potential security breaches requiring analyst review | SOC Analyst → SOC Supervisor |
| **High (L3)** | Confirmed security incident with operational impact | SOC Supervisor → Incident Response Team |
| **Critical (L4)** | Major security incident affecting business continuity | Incident Response Team → CISO → Executive Management |

### **Escalation Timelines:**
- **L1:** Reviewed within **24 hours**
- **L2:** Investigated within **6 hours**
- **L3:** Mitigated within **2 hours**
- **L4:** Immediate escalation within **15 minutes**

### **Response Workflow (ISO/IEC 27035 & NIST 800-61):**
1. **Detection & Reporting** → Security event is detected and reported.
2. **Assessment & Triage** → Analyst evaluates the severity and potential impact.
3. **Containment** → Immediate steps taken to prevent further damage.
4. **Investigation & Analysis** → Determine the root cause and scope of impact.
5. **Eradication & Recovery** → Remove the threat and restore operations securely.
6. **Post-Incident Review** → Analyze incident lessons and update response plans.

## **4. Incident Response Plan (Based on NIST 800-61 & ISO/IEC 27035)**

### **Objective:**
Provide a structured approach to handling security incidents, minimizing damage, and ensuring business continuity.

### **Key Phases:**
| **Phase** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Preparation** | Establish policies, procedures, tools, and training for incident handling. |
| **Detection & Analysis** | Identify security events, assess impact, and classify incidents. |
| **Containment, Eradication & Recovery** | Isolate affected systems, remove threats, and restore services securely. |
| **Post-Incident Activity** | Conduct incident post-mortem analysis and improve security posture. |

### **Incident Categories:**
| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-------------|-------------|
| Malware | Ransomware, worms, trojans |
| Phishing | Email scams, credential theft |
| Denial-of-Service | DDoS, network flooding |
| Unauthorized Access | Insider threats, privilege escalation |
| Data Breach | Personal or corporate data exposure |

### **Best Practices:**
- Follow **ISO/IEC 27035** for structured incident handling and lessons learned.
- Implement **playbooks** for each category of incident.
- Conduct **regular incident response training and exercises.**

## **5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

### **Objective:**
Measure SOC efficiency and effectiveness in handling security incidents.

### **Essential SOC KPIs:**
| **KPI** | **Description** | **Target Benchmark** |
|------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| **MTTD** | Time taken to detect incidents | <30 minutes |
| **MTTR** | Time taken to contain and remediate threats | <60 minutes |
| **False Positive Rate** | Percentage of false alerts out of total alerts | <5% |
| **Incident Closure Rate** | Percentage of incidents resolved within SLA | >95% |
| **SOC Coverage** | Percentage of security logs monitored | >98% |
| **Automation Efficiency** | Percentage of incidents handled via automation | >50% |

### **SOC Performance Monitoring Strategies:**
- Conduct **monthly incident reviews** to analyze detection and response efficiency.
- Implement **SIEM dashboards** to visualize incident trends and response times.
- Use **machine learning models** to predict and improve detection accuracy.
