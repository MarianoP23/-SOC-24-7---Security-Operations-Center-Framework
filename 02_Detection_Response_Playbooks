# SOC Detection & Response Playbooks

## Overview
Detection & Response Playbooks provide **step-by-step guidance** for handling security incidents in a **structured and repeatable manner**. These playbooks align with industry standards such as **NIST 800-61 (Incident Handling Guide), MITRE ATT&CK, ISO 27035 (Incident Management), CIS Controls, and PCI DSS**. Each playbook ensures **rapid response, containment, and remediation** while minimizing business impact.

## **1. Phishing Attack Playbook**

### **Objective**
Detect, analyze, contain, and remediate **phishing emails and credential harvesting attempts** targeting employees.

### **Detection Methods**
- **SIEM Rules:** Monitor for mass suspicious emails containing malicious URLs or attachments.
- **Email Security Gateway:** Detects known phishing domains.
- **User Reports:** Employees report suspicious emails via phishing simulation tools (e.g., Microsoft Defender, Proofpoint, Mimecast).
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds:** Check phishing URLs against databases like PhishTank and VirusTotal.

### **Incident Response Steps**
1. **Detection & Identification**
   - Validate phishing email reports.
   - Extract and analyze email headers.
   - Check URLs using **sandbox analysis** and **threat intelligence feeds**.
2. **Containment**
   - Block phishing domains in **email security tools (Proofpoint, Mimecast, Microsoft Defender)**.
   - Blacklist malicious IPs in **firewalls (Palo Alto, FortiGate, Cisco Firepower)**.
   - Force password reset for targeted users.
3. **Eradication & Recovery**
   - Remove phishing emails from inboxes via **email security tools**.
   - Scan affected workstations using **CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender**.
   - Check for unauthorized account access in **IAM systems (Okta, Microsoft Entra ID)**.
4. **Lessons Learned & Reporting**
   - Conduct user training for phishing awareness.
   - Update security controls based on **attack TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK T1566)**.
   - Report the incident per **ISO 27035 and NIST guidelines**.

## **2. Ransomware Attack Playbook**

### **Objective**
Detect, contain, and remediate **ransomware attacks** to minimize data loss and operational disruption.

### **Detection Methods**
- **SIEM Rules:** Detect sudden file encryption, high CPU usage, and anomalous SMB traffic.
- **EDR Alerts:** Monitor for **fileless malware, process injection (MITRE ATT&CK T1055), and persistence mechanisms (T1547).**
- **Network IDS/IPS:** Identify **C2 traffic (MITRE ATT&CK T1071)** to known ransomware servers.
- **User Reports:** Employees report files encrypted with unknown extensions.

### **Incident Response Steps**
1. **Detection & Identification**
   - Verify if ransomware indicators exist (e.g., file encryption, ransom note, process execution).
   - Identify the ransomware strain (e.g., LockBit, Ryuk, Conti) using **threat intelligence databases**.
2. **Containment**
   - **Isolate affected systems** (EDR containment, VLAN isolation, or NAC policy enforcement).
   - Block external communications to **C2 servers (firewall updates, DNS sinkholing).**
   - Disable compromised accounts and reset credentials.
3. **Eradication & Recovery**
   - Use **offline backups** to restore encrypted files (verifying backup integrity).
   - Remove malware persistence mechanisms (bootkits, scheduled tasks, registry modifications).
   - Conduct forensic analysis to prevent reinfection.
4. **Lessons Learned & Reporting**
   - Implement **application allowlisting** to prevent unauthorized executables.
   - Improve **endpoint protection policies** and SIEM detection rules.
   - Report ransomware incidents per **CISA and GDPR requirements**.

## **3. Insider Threat Playbook**

### **Objective**
Detect, investigate, and mitigate insider threats, including **data exfiltration, privilege abuse, and unauthorized access**.

### **Detection Methods**
- **DLP (Data Loss Prevention) Alerts:** Monitor for **sensitive data transfers (MITRE ATT&CK T1020, T1036).**
- **User Behavior Analytics (UBA):** Detect **unusual access patterns, privilege escalation attempts**.
- **SIEM & IAM Logs:** Identify **abnormal login behavior, excessive access requests**.
- **Endpoint Monitoring:** Track unauthorized data copying to **USB, cloud storage, or personal email**.

### **Incident Response Steps**
1. **Detection & Identification**
   - Investigate DLP alerts, **Active Directory logs, VPN access logs**.
   - Conduct risk-based profiling of users engaging in abnormal activities.
   - Verify if compromised credentials are being used for privilege escalation.
2. **Containment**
   - Restrict access to **critical systems and data**.
   - Suspend the userâ€™s account while the investigation is conducted.
   - Block exfiltration channels (email, cloud, removable storage).
3. **Eradication & Recovery**
   - **Reset passwords and enforce MFA**.
   - Remove unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
   - Improve insider threat detection rules in **SIEM and UEBA tools**.
4. **Lessons Learned & Reporting**
   - Conduct a **forensic review of account activity**.
   - Strengthen **least privilege and Zero Trust policies**.
   - Report incidents according to **ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and NIST guidelines**.
