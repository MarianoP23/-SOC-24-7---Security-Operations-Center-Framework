# Building a 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC)

## SOC Architecture & Infrastructure

A **24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC)** is the backbone of an organizationâ€™s cybersecurity posture. It consists of **people, processes, and technologies** working together to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in real-time. Below is a detailed breakdown of its **architecture and infrastructure** components.

---

## **1. Core Components of a 24/7 SOC**

### **1.1 Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
A **SIEM** is the heart of a SOC, collecting and analyzing logs from multiple sources to detect security incidents. 

âœ… **Key Responsibilities:**
- Aggregating logs from **network devices, servers, cloud environments, and endpoints**.
- Correlating events to detect patterns indicative of threats.
- Generating alerts and providing forensic capabilities.

ðŸ”¹ **Top SIEM Solutions:**
- **Splunk** (Enterprise SIEM & Security Analytics)
- **IBM QRadar** (Advanced Threat Intelligence)
- **Microsoft Sentinel** (Cloud-native SIEM)
- **Elastic Security** (Open-source SIEM with analytics)

### **1.2 Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)**
A **SOAR** platform automates incident response, reducing **MTTD (Mean Time to Detect) and MTTR (Mean Time to Respond).**

âœ… **Key Responsibilities:**
- Automating repetitive security tasks (e.g., blocking malicious IPs, isolating endpoints).
- Integrating with **SIEM, EDR, and IDS/IPS**.
- Playbook-driven response workflows.

ðŸ”¹ **Top SOAR Solutions:**
- **Splunk SOAR (Phantom)**
- **Cortex XSOAR**
- **IBM Resilient**
- **Microsoft Sentinel Playbooks**

### **1.3 Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR/XDR)**
EDR provides deep visibility into endpoint activity, allowing real-time threat detection and response.

âœ… **Key Responsibilities:**
- Detecting **fileless malware, ransomware, and insider threats**.
- Providing detailed forensic analysis and threat intelligence.
- Quarantine and remediation capabilities.

ðŸ”¹ **Top EDR/XDR Solutions:**
- **CrowdStrike Falcon** (Cloud-based EDR)
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** (Windows-native EDR)
- **SentinelOne** (Autonomous AI-driven detection)
- **Palo Alto Cortex XDR** (Extended detection & response)

### **1.4 Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDS/IPS)**
IDS/IPS solutions **monitor network traffic** for malicious activities and prevent cyber attacks.

âœ… **Key Responsibilities:**
- Detecting suspicious patterns in network traffic.
- Preventing malware infections and command-and-control (C2) communications.
- Providing real-time alerts and forensic logs.

ðŸ”¹ **Top IDS/IPS Solutions:**
- **Snort (Open-source IDS/IPS)**
- **Cisco Firepower**
- **Palo Alto Threat Prevention**
- **Suricata (High-performance IDS/IPS)**

### **1.5 Threat Intelligence Feeds & Platforms**
A **threat intelligence (TI) platform** enhances threat detection by **ingesting real-time feeds from global security sources.**

âœ… **Key Responsibilities:**
- Enriching alerts with contextual threat data.
- Detecting **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**.
- Reducing false positives using behavioral analytics.

ðŸ”¹ **Top Threat Intelligence Platforms:**
- **Recorded Future** (AI-driven threat intelligence)
- **AlienVault OTX** (Open-source threat feed)
- **IBM X-Force Exchange** (Global threat database)
- **MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)**

### **1.6 Log Management & Data Retention**
A **long-term log retention strategy** is crucial for forensic investigations and regulatory compliance.

âœ… **Key Responsibilities:**
- Storing security logs for **6 months â€“ 7 years** (depending on regulations).
- Ensuring **log integrity and encryption**.
- Supporting compliance requirements like **ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR, HIPAA**.

ðŸ”¹ **Top Log Management Solutions:**
- **Splunk** (Enterprise log aggregation)
- **Graylog** (Open-source logging)
- **Elastic Stack (ELK)** (Scalable log management)

## **2. SOC Network Architecture**
A **SOC network architecture** must be **highly resilient, segmented, and redundant** to ensure **continuous monitoring** and **threat detection**.

### **2.1 Core SOC Infrastructure Design**
ðŸ“Œ **Key Components:**
- **Tiered Network Segmentation** (SOC, DMZ, Corporate, OT/ICS Segments)
- **Redundant SIEM & Data Storage Nodes**
- **Zero Trust Security Controls**
- **24/7 Monitoring Dashboards**

### **2.2 High Availability (HA) & Redundancy**
- **SOC should have primary and secondary data centers.**
- **Use multi-cloud SIEM for resilience.**
- **Backup security logs and forensic data in separate locations.**

## **4. SOC Deployment Best Practices**

ðŸ“Œ **Security Principles for SOC Design:**
âœ” **Defense in Depth (DiD)** â€“ Multiple layers of security controls.
âœ” **Zero Trust** â€“ Verify every access request.
âœ” **Least Privilege Access** â€“ Minimize user permissions.
âœ” **Continuous Monitoring** â€“ 24/7 log analysis & alerting.
âœ” **Automated Incident Response** â€“ SOAR playbooks & workflows.
âœ” **Threat Hunting Capabilities** â€“ Proactively searching for threats.
âœ” **Compliance Alignment** â€“ SOC aligned with NIST, ISO 27001, and other frameworks.
