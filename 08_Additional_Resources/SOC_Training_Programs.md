# Developing Training Programs for SOC Teams

## **Overview**
A **well-structured SOC training program** is critical for improving the skills, efficiency, and readiness of cybersecurity teams. This document outlines **training methodologies, role-based learning paths, certifications, and hands-on labs** to enhance the expertise of SOC personnel. The program aligns with **NIST 800-181, MITRE ATT&CK, and ISO/IEC 27035** best practices.

## **1. Training Methodologies**

### **1.1 Role-Based Training**
Each SOC role requires tailored training to ensure competency in **threat detection, investigation, and response.**

| **SOC Role** | **Training Focus** | **Key Learning Areas** |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| SOC Analyst (L1) | Alert Triage & Incident Monitoring | SIEM, EDR, IDS/IPS, Log Analysis |
| SOC Investigator (L2) | Threat Investigation & Forensics | Malware Analysis, DFIR, Threat Hunting |
| Threat Hunter | Proactive Threat Detection | MITRE ATT&CK, Anomaly Detection, Adversary Tactics |
| SOC Engineer | SIEM & Security Automation | SOAR, Detection Rule Creation, Log Correlation |
| SOC Manager | SOC Operations & Metrics | Incident Response Planning, KPIs, Compliance |
| CISO / Director | Cybersecurity Strategy | Risk Management, Governance, Compliance |

---

### **1.2 Training Techniques**
- **Hands-on Labs:** Simulated attack environments for practical experience.
- **Tabletop Exercises:** Scenario-based incident response practice.
- **Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges:** Gamified threat detection competitions.
- **Red vs. Blue Team Drills:** Offensive vs. defensive security exercises.
- **Continuous Learning:** Weekly threat intel briefings, security research.

## **2. Certification Pathway**

| **SOC Role** | **Recommended Certifications** |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| SOC Analyst (L1) | CompTIA Security+, GIAC GSEC, Splunk Core Certified User |
| SOC Investigator (L2) | GIAC GCIA, GIAC GCIH, OSCP |
| Threat Hunter | GIAC GCTI, Threat Hunting Certified Specialist |
| SOC Engineer | Splunk Certified Architect, Elastic Certified Analyst |
| SOC Manager | CISM, CISSP, ISO 27001 Lead Auditor |
| CISO / Director | CISM, CISSP, CCISO |

## **3. Hands-on Lab Environments**
- **SIEM Training:** Creating detection rules, analyzing security logs (Splunk, ELK, QRadar).
- **EDR Analysis:** Investigating endpoint threats using CrowdStrike, SentinelOne.
- **Threat Hunting Labs:** Analyzing attacker TTPs using MITRE ATT&CK.
- **Incident Response Simulation:** Practicing IR workflows in a sandboxed environment.
- **Malware Analysis:** Reverse-engineering ransomware and APT attacks.

## **4. Training Metrics & Evaluation**

| **Metric** | **Description** | **Benchmark** |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Training Completion Rate | Percentage of employees who complete training | >95% |
| Hands-on Lab Success Rate | Percentage of successfully completed labs | >85% |
| Incident Response Time Improvement | Reduction in MTTD/MTTR after training | 30%+ |
| Threat Detection Accuracy | Reduction in false positives and missed alerts | 20%+ improvement |

## **5. Continuous Learning & Improvement**
✅ **Bi-Weekly Threat Intelligence Briefings** (Emerging threats, new TTPs).  
✅ **Quarterly Red Team Simulations** (Adversary emulation tests).  
✅ **Annual SOC Certification Program** (Skill development roadmap).  
✅ **Incident Debriefs & Post-Mortems** (Lessons learned analysis).
